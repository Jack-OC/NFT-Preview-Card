## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned
In course of completing this challenge I learned how to design an overlay to create an active hover state when scrolling on an image. To avoid having to change the image in any way, you can put an overlay ontop of an image. I used a div containing the view svg to have an overlay on the equilibrium image. This div has the secondary colour as its background and the view svg as an image placed in the center of it using Flexbox. I also learned about how to use css transitions when designing the overlay. CSS transitions allow you to change properties over a given time of an element. I will continue to learn more about the posible uses of CSS transitions.
